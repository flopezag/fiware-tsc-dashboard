Catalogue -> unique per all the FIWARE, if we want to measure the access to each of them we should have one repository (catalogue) per GE

             Ref: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/traffic/
               Traffic -> Views

             Get the total number of views and breakdown per day or week for the last 14 days. Timestamps are aligned
             to UTC midnight of the beginning of the day or week. Week begins on Monday.
     
             Send and email to Jason in order to coordinate this issue.
             (Issue #28)

Academy -> Global, each GE has its own page (e.g. https://fiware-academy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/quantum-leap/index.html)

           Check: Could be possible to measure in Google Analytics at a level of page? Need to investigate it.
           Email to Jason to coordinate this action.
           (Issue #29)

ReadTheDocs -> Still on going. Nothing change here.

Docker -> Still on going -> pending to upload the changes (locally) in the following release.
          (Issue #30)

Github (Assets) -> Still on going, nothing change

Github_* -> still on going, nothing change.

Coverall (Coverage) -> At the moment, it is useless... only Telefónica stuff almost, check with Jason Unit Tests.
                       Nevertheless, I discovered in the FIWARE Requirements (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Pzhbq-xwd8gTCvYqeNkfaoDt-iGCedc1zlb_elxv2M/edit)
                       that there is a MAY about this field and several of them mention that they configure it.
                       Probably it is a matter to update the content.
                       (Issue #31)

HelpDesk -> Check meaning, We provide the information about the total number of tickets, the percentage of still not
            closed tickets and the mean of resolve time of them in the Help Desk. It was obtained from the backlog tool
            (https://backlog.fiware.org/) but we decide to dismiss it —> Need to redefine the source of information to
            obtain this information.
            (Issue #32)

Backlog -> How to measure the progress of the Roadmap... Currently, It is useless…
           Sent an email to Jason in order to coordinate this metric. Pending more details to evolve this metric.
           (Issue #33)

Jira WorkItems -> No changes, related to the FIWARE GE project in JIRA, not used any more.
                  If there is no use, we can dismiss these metrics from the overall process. Let me confirm it before
                  delete the functionality from the current version.
                  (Issue #34)
